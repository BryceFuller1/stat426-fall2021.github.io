Many disciplines, including statistics, finance, and business, use data visualization to convey information quickly and efficiently to their audience. As such, there are many libraries and packages that have been created to help people make all sorts of plots and graphs. Plotly is a data visualization library that you can use to create beautiful and interactive graphs, and is supported in different programing languages such as Python, R, and Julia. It has become a popular library for data visualization because it is easy to implement code, makes visually appealing graphics, and the plots are user-interactive. These plots are expecially useful during exploratory data analysis, where you can create a graphic and then click around and look at individual points. It is also a great tool to share with your audience, who can interact with the graph themselves.

## Installation 

If you are using Python, plotly many be installed using pip or pip 3:

```python
pip install plotly
```

Or you can install using conda:

```python
conda install -c plotly plotly=5.3.1
```
## Boxplots

One of the basics of data graphics is the boxplot. Anytime we want to use plotly, we can call the library at the beginning of our session. The standard way to do this is:


```python
import plotly.express as px
```

Where "px" will be the function you use to create graphs. Using the well-known iris dataset built into R, we can create a boxplot at each sepal length of petal_length:

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()

fig = px.box(df, x="sepal_length", y="petal_length")
fig.show()
```

A graphic like the one above will appear. In your window, you will be able to interact with it by hovering over a single sepal length's boxplot, and it will tell you things like: min, max, q3, q4, and median.

## Scatterplots

Another nice feature you can take advantage of is scatterplots. You use the command px.scatter, and then define your x and y variables. One really cool feature here, is you can add another layer of information to your graph by color-coding it by a third variable. you can do this by using the color argument shown below. In the example code, we color coded by what species the flower is. Plotly will automatically create a legend for what color is what species.

```python
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species", title="A Plotly Express Figure")

fig.show()
```

When someone uses SQL, they're usually using it to query a database. Most database management engines, such
as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, and Microsoft Access each use SQL to perform their queries. APIs
for databases also often use SQL. Although some specifics may vary from program to program, the overall
language tends to be very standardized. For example, the following query will return the petal length
of every setosa in the "iris" dataset: 

```sql
SELECT Petal_Length FROM iris WHERE Species = setosa
```

If you're pulling data directly from a data warehouse, you can typically use queries like this to format 
and filter the data so you only download what you need. However, sometimes you are obtaining the data
from another source, such as a csv file. Most of these files will need some sort of data cleaning, and 
while the language you're using likely has methods for this cleaning built in, the queries provided by
SQL might seem like a desirable alternative. Thankfully, most programming languages have some way to
perform SQL queries on data that's already been imported. 

## SQL in Python: pandasql

In Python, the [pandasql](https://pypi.org/project/pandasql/) package lets you query pandas dataframes
as if they were in your data warehouse, and will return another pandas dataframe. The `sqldf` method
in the package requires two arguments. The first argument is a string containing the query you want to
submit, while the second indicates whether the dataframe you want to query is in `locals()` or `globals()`.
Running the method will perform that query, returning a dataframe. 

```python
from pandasql import sqldf
setosaPetals = sqldf("SELECT Petal_Length FROM iris WHERE Species = setosa", globals())
```
If you're doing several queries in one program, it may be tedious to include `locals()` or `globals()` in
every instance. In that case, you can define a function to include it for you:

```python
from pandasql import sqldf
pysqldf = lambda q: sqldf(q, globals())
setosaPetals = pysqldf("SELECT Petal_Length FROM iris WHERE Species = setosa")
```

## SQL in R: sqldf

The [sqldf](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sqldf/) package in R is very similar to the pandasql 
package in Python. Because R doesn't use methods and doesn't typically distinguish between 
local and global variables, sqldf takes less code than pandasql. Otherwise, they are essentially the
same; simply input a string query, and it will be run on the specified data frame so long as it's been
defined in your local environment. 

```splus
library(sqldf)
setosaPetals <- sqldf("SELECT Petal_Length FROM iris WHERE Species = setosa")
```

## SQL in SAS: PROC SQL

Another programming language you may wish to use SQL in is SAS. SAS is set up quite differently than
most other programming languages, since it's already very focused on manipulating tables. In fact, a
method of manipulating tables using SQL is built in to SAS! 

The 
[PROC SQL](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.5/sqlproc/n1lhnlzhrmrqggn1rz570u89oq2m.htm)
step works similarly to other `proc` steps, but with a few differences. Most notably, you need to end your 
step with `quit;` instead of `run;`. Otherwise, simply input your query as a single statement to send the
result to your output: 

```sas
PROC SQL;
  SELECT Petal_Length FROM iris 
  WHERE Species = setosa;
QUIT;
```

If you'd rather send the query results to another table, simply start the query with `create table`
followed by the name of the new table:

```sas
PROC SQL;
  CREATE TABLE setosaPetals AS
  SELECT Petal_Length FROM iris 
  WHERE Species = setosa;
QUIT;
```

## Conclusion

SQL queries are a versatile tool for manipulating data from data warehouses, but that's not their only
usage. Even if you already have data loaded into your environment, you can often perform queries on that
data. While other tools exist that can reshape the data into what you need, SQL is a simple and 
consistent tool that can be used in many different programs.
