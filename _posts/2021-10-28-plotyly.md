Many disciplines, including statistics, finance, and business, use data visualization to convey information quickly and efficiently to their audience. As such, there are many libraries and packages that have been created to help people make all sorts of plots and graphs. Plotly is a data visualization library that you can use to create beautiful and interactive graphs, and is supported in different programing languages such as Python, R, and Julia. It has become a popular library for data visualization because it is easy to implement code, makes visually appealing graphics, and the plots are user-interactive. These plots are expecially useful during exploratory data analysis, where you can create a graphic and then click around and look at individual points. It is also a great tool to share with your audience, who can interact with the graph themselves.

## Installation 

If you are using Python, plotly many be installed using pip or pip 3:

```python
pip install plotly
```

Or you can install using conda:

```python
conda install -c plotly plotly=5.3.1
```
## Boxplots

One of the basics of data graphics is the boxplot. Anytime we want to use plotly, we can call the library at the beginning of our session. The standard way to do this is:


```python
import plotly.express as px
```

Where "px" will be the function you use to create graphs. Using the well-known iris dataset built into R, we can create a boxplot at each sepal length of petal_length:

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()

fig = px.box(df, x="sepal_length", y="petal_length")
fig.show()
```

A graphic like the one above will appear. In your window, you will be able to interact with it by hovering over a single sepal length's boxplot, and it will tell you things like: min, max, q3, q4, and median.

## Scatterplots

Another nice feature you can take advantage of is scatterplots. You use the command px.scatter, and then define your x and y variables. One really cool feature here, is you can add another layer of information to your graph by color-coding it by a third variable. you can do this by using the color argument shown below. In the example code, we color coded by what species the flower is. Plotly will automatically create a legend for what color is what species.

```python
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species", title="A Plotly Express Figure")

fig.show()
```

## Making a 

We can make subplots within another subplot with Plotly.subplots.make


## Conclusion

SQL queries are a versatile tool for manipulating data from data warehouses, but that's not their only
usage. Even if you already have data loaded into your environment, you can often perform queries on that
data. While other tools exist that can reshape the data into what you need, SQL is a simple and 
consistent tool that can be used in many different programs.
