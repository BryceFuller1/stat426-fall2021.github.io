Many disciplines, including statistics, finance, and business, use data visualization to convey information quickly and efficiently to their audience. As such, there are many libraries and packages that have been created to help people make all sorts of plots and graphs. Plotly is a data visualization library that you can use to create beautiful and interactive graphs, and is supported in different programing languages such as Python, R, and Julia. It has become a popular library for data visualization because it is easy to implement code, makes visually appealing graphics, and the plots are user-interactive. These plots are expecially useful during exploratory data analysis, where you can create a graphic and then click around and look at individual points. It is also a great tool to share with your audience, who can interact with the graph themselves.

## Installation 

If you are using Python, plotly many be installed using pip or pip 3:

```python
pip install plotly
```

Or you can install using conda:

```python
conda install -c plotly plotly=5.3.1
```

## Boxplots

One of the basics of data graphics is the boxplot. Anytime we want to use plotly, we can call the library at the beginning of our session. The standard way to do this is:


```python
import plotly.express as px
```

Where "px" will be the function you use to create graphs. Using the well-known iris dataset built into R, we can create a boxplot at each sepal length of petal_length:

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()

fig = px.box(df, x="sepal_length", y="petal_length")
fig.show()
```

A graphic like the one above will appear. In your window, you will be able to interact with it by hovering over a single sepal length's boxplot, and it will tell you things like: min, max, q3, q4, and median.

## Boxplots

Another basic but important tool in plotly is <'px.bar'>, which generates bar graphs. We define the dataframe, and then the x and y variables we want to look at. One really cool feature here, is you can add another layer of information to your graph by color-coding it by a third variable. you can do this by using the color argument shown below. In the example code, we color coded by what species the flower is. Plotly will automatically create a legend for what color is what species.

## Scatterplots

Another nice feature you can take advantage of is scatterplots. You use the command px.scatter, and then define your x and y variables. One really cool feature here, is you can add another layer of information to your graph by color-coding it by a third variable. you can do this by using the color argument shown below. In the example code, we color coded by the same variable as we did above, which is species.

```python
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species", title="A Plotly Express Figure")

fig.show()
```

## Adding a trendline
We can add a trendline to our scatterplot using the `< trendline="ols" >` arguement. It will make a trendline for each species, since we keep the `< color="species" >` argument

```python
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species", trendline="ols",title="A Plotly Express Figure")

fig.show()
```

## Posting your Plotly Graphic Online

We have gone over a few simple tricks 


## Conclusion

The plotly library is almost limitless, and can generate almost any kind of chart or plot you can think of. This post is only an introduction into what plotly can do. There is great documentation beyond this post that you can find on plotly's site that will help you further your graphic skills. Post below in the comment sections examples where you have successfully used plotly, and if possible, attach pictures or code to go with it.
